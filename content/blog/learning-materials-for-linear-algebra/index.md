There are tons of resources on the internet. As a total beginner, I find some tutorials are more beginner-friendly than others. Here is my list, happy learning!🥳

# Textbooks

- [Introduction to Linear Algebra, Fifth Edition](https://math.mit.edu/~gs/linearalgebra/) by Gilbert Strang.(**Highly recommended!**)
- [Linear Algebra and Its Applications, 5th Edition](https://www.amazon.com/Linear-Algebra-Its-Applications-5th/dp/032198238X) by David C Lay, Judith McDonald, and Steven R Lay.(**Awesome!**)
- [Linear algebra done right](https://linear.axler.net/) by Sheldon Axler.

# Tutorials

These videos are pretty short, but they are well delivered and very helpful for understanding concepts!

- [The Organic Chemistry Tutor](https://www.youtube.com/c/TheOrganicChemistryTutor/featured)
- [3Blue1Brown](https://www.youtube.com/c/3blue1brown)
- [Linear Algebra Lectures](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLNr8B4XHL5kGDHOrU4IeI6QNuZHur4F86)(This series follows _Linear Algebra and Its Applications_.)
